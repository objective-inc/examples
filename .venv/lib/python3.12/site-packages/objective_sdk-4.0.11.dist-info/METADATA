# Objective, Inc. Python Library

This is the official python library for the Objective APIs. It provides convenient methods for using Objective's APIs. 

## Documentation

Our documentation can be found at [docs.objective.inc](https://docs.objective.inc).

## Install and configure API key

To get an API key today join the [waitlist](https://www.objective.inc/contact).

```bash
pip install objective-sdk
```

## Quickstart


### Upload your objects

Push schemaless JSON objects to the Object Store. This enables their contents to be indexed for search.

```python
from objective import Client

client = Client(api_key="sk_...")

objects = []

objects.append(
    {
        "id": "1",
        "object": {
            "title": "Sevendayz Men's Shady Records Eminem Hoodie Hoody Black Medium",
            "brand": "sevendayz"
        },
    },
)


client.object_store.upsert_objects(objects)
```
which will upsert your objects and let you know once the operation is complete:
```
Successfully upserted 1 object.
```

You can use `client.object_store.delete_objects(["1"])` to delete this object from the object store.

### Create an index and wait for indexing to be completed

Create a search Index, which triggers the objects in the Object Store to be indexed.
See our [docs](https://www.objective.inc/docs/index/api/create-index) for all options.

```python
from objective import Client

client = Client(api_key="sk_...")

index = client.indexes.create_index(
    index_type="text-neural-base", fields={"searchable": ["title", "brand"]}
)
index.status(watch=True)
```
which returns information on how the objects are being processed and indexed:

```
Index idx_wXRUedqJkPof successfully created.
Progress: [---------------------------------------------------------------] 0%
```

### Search

Once the objects are live in the index, issue search requests.

```python
from objective import Client
import json

client = Client(api_key="sk_...")
index = client.indexes.get_index(<<INSERT INDEX ID HERE>>)

results = index.search(query="rapper hoodies", object_fields="*")
print(json.dumps(results, indent=4))
```

which outputs the following search result format:

```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "object": {"title": "Sevendayz Men's Shady Records Eminem Hoodie Hoody Black Medium", "brand": "sevendayz"}
        }
    ],
    "pagination": {
        "pages": 1,
        "page": 1,
        "next": null
    }
}
```

Congratulations, you just indexed and searched your first objects. To learn more and see more example code, check out our [docs](https://www.objective.inc/docs).
